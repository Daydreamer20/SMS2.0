# School Management System (SMS)

A comprehensive solution for managing educational institutions, providing tools for administrators, teachers, students, and parents.

## Overview

The School Management System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the administrative and academic processes of educational institutions. It offers a suite of modules for managing users, students, classes, attendance, examinations, and more.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with three primary components:
- **User Module** - Authentication and user management
- **Admin Module** - Administrative functions and school operations
- **Student Module** - Student-related data and activities

Each module connects to a centralized database service layer.

## Features

- **User Management**: Authentication, authorization, and role-based access control
- **Admin Dashboard**: School settings, teacher management, and class configuration
- **Student Management**: Profiles, attendance, grades, and performance tracking
- **Course Management**: Curriculum planning, timetable creation, and resource allocation
- **Communication**: Parent-teacher communication and notifications
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics
